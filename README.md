A look at treatment success for squamouse cell carcinoma (SCC) in mice over a period of 45 days. Tumor delevopment was measured and compared to main drug of interest, Capomulin, versus other treatments applied.

According to the data, tumor volume (mm3) decreased over time when the mice were treated with Capomulin, as observed with random patient Mouse s185.
However, mice treated with the Ramicane regimen had the most success in tumor volume reduction over the treatment period. Conversely, Infubinol displayed the singular outlier of the four main treatments tracked as well as the highest tumor volume sizes at the end of treatment. There is a positive correlation between weight of the mouse and average volume of their tumor.
